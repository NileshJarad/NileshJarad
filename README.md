Hi, I’m a seasoned Android developer with over 11 years of hands-on experience building scalable, user-centric mobile applications.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked across diverse domains including edtech, fintech, healthtech, and enterprise mobility. This breadth of experience has given me a strong foundation for understanding different user needs and quickly adapting to various business models.

🛠️ My Android expertise covers a wide range of technologies—from core Java and Kotlin to modern frameworks like Jetpack Compose, Coroutines, and Koin (DI). I follow clean architecture principles and prefer the MVVM pattern to ensure code that’s both maintainable and testable.

Beyond coding, I’ve led major app rewrites, participated in system design discussions, and mentored junior developers. I enjoy solving real-world problems through technology and am always eager to explore new tools and trends in the mobile development space.

🚀 Currently focused on:

- Jetpack Compose
- App performance optimization
- Improving the App security using SSL, Root detection, Tapjacking

📚 Currently learning:
- Node.js
- React Native
- PostgreSQL
